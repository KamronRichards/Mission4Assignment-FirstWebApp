<h2>What I hope to get out of IS 413:</h2>
<p>The main thing I hope to get out of this course will be to learn programming in C# that will be dynamic and effective in a enterprise level of programming. I also hope to recieve the help and guidance needed to become a better programmer. Another thing I hope to gain from this course is a knowledge that programming can be fun.</p>
